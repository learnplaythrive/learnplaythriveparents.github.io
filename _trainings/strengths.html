  You may have heard that Autistic kids are visual learners. But as their caregiver, you still feel stuck navigating routines, transitions, and activities. And putting pictures on things just doesn't help. In this three hour course, occupational therapist and Learn Play Thrive founder Meg Ferrell teaches you how to truly build from your child's strengths to support them during their real daily activities.

          <b>Part 1:</b> Take Your Child's Perspective
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most of us were never taught about the Autistic neurotype. Or worse, we were taught pathologizing ideas that don't truly reflect the broad, varied, and deeply human ways that Autistic people experience the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll start the course by diving deep into what we know about how Autistic people think and experience the world, with input from Autistic adults with many different intersectional identities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then you'll learn a process for problem-solving tough moments and routines by starting with your <i>child's</i> perspective. You’ll use what you’ve learned about the Autistic neurotype to create dozens of hypotheses about why your child is struggling. And we’ll teach you how to map from there to strengths-based interventions.
        </p>

      <div class="part">
        <h3>
          <b>Part 2:</b> Learn, Play & Thrive!
        </h3>
        <p>
          At Learn Play Thrive, we love child-led therapy sessions. But we also know that your daily routine has a lot of transitions, and that there are a lot of things your child needs to do.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to help you create and use visual supports, environmental adaptations, and skillful teaching to support them in every transition.
        </p>

        <p>
          This module includes instruction in how to support more concrete thinkers (who learn best from objects, not pictures), all the way through kids who easily read written words.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll teach you how to support your child in pre-academic and academic skills, self-care routines, and so much more.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ll show you how to easily make schedules your child actually wants to use and can use flexibly, instead of creating something that gets ignored or turns into a memorized routine that can’t be easily changed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we’ll tell you everything we know about Autistic play, and how you can help your child thrive during free time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="part">
        <h3>
          <b>Part 3:</b> What's Next?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the final module, we’ll walk you through a few case studies that put all of the LPT Approach principles into action with kids going out into the community to participate fully and joyfully in their real daily lives with strengths-based supports in place.
