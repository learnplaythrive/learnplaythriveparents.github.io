<p>Augmentative &amp; Alternative Communication (AAC) gives non-speaking Autistic kids a way to share their inner world - their thoughts, feelings, needs, and wants - with those around them. But how do you introduce an AAC device? How do you fit it into your busy life? And how does your child learn to use it? In this talk, SLP Karina Saechao gives practical, easy-to-implement tips for families to introduce AAC to their child in a way that is truly child-driven, supporting kids to communicate the things that matter most to them at the times they want to say it. She also shares ways to ensure your AAC device reflects your childâ€™s language, family, and culture. Karina is an SLP, researcher and the owner of <a href="https://www.goldenoakspeech.com/">Golden Oak Speech Therapy</a>.</p>
