<p>For Autistic PDAers, it's so hard to feel safe in this world. PDA stands for Pathological Demand Avoidance (or, as rebranded by <a href="http://tomlinwilding.com/neuropsychology/neurodiversity/pathological-demand-avoidance/">Tomlin Wilding</a>, the Pervasive Drive for Autonomy). PDAers experience everyday demands as a deep threat to their nervous system. And this impacts everything from eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom to playing games and learning. In this talk, Casey Ehrlich from <a href="https://www.atpeaceparents.com/">At Peace Parents</a> gives caregivers a starting point for understanding PDA and supporting their PDA child in a whole-hearted, compassionate, and practical way to create a felt sense of safety for their child.</p>
