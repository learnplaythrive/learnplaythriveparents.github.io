Neurologically, inclusion is a survival need. And while Autistic kids often play differently than their Allistic (non-Autistic) peers, they need and deserve to feel included in their social spaces. SLP Lindsay Teitelbalm believes the social model of disability is the way forward, where we rely on one another to support the inclusion of disabled and neurodivergent people in all settings. In this talk, she’ll give you the concrete skills to advocate for your Autistic child’s social inclusion. Lindsay is the founder of [Spirited Play Labs](https://spiritedplaylabs.com/).
