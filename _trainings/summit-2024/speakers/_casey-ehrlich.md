For Autistic PDAers, itâ€™s so hard to feel safe in this world. PDA stands for Pathological Demand Avoidance (or, as rebranded by [Tomlin Wilding](http://tomlinwilding.com/neuropsychology/neurodiversity/pathological-demand-avoidance/), the Pervasive Drive for Autonomy). PDAers experience everyday demands as a deep threat to their nervous system. And this impacts everything from eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom to playing games and learning. In this talk, Casey Ehrlich from [At Peace Parents](https://www.atpeaceparents.com/) gives caregivers a starting point for understanding PDA and supporting their PDA child in a whole-hearted, compassionate, and practical way to create a felt sense of safety for their child.
