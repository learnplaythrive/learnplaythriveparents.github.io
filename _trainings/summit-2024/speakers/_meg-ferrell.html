<p>Often teachers and therapists learn that Autistic kids are "visual learners" and begin to put clipart on everything, including the child's schedule. While this is well-intentioned, sometimes it just doesn't land. Being a visual learner doesn't automatically mean you make sense of clipart. And for most families, picture schedules are nearly impossible to create, keep track of, and use. Especially with all of the day-to-day changes in our lives. In this talk, Learn Play Thrive founder Meg Ferrell will teach you how create simple, effective schedules using everyday objects when the clip-art isn't doing the trick. Meg Ferrell is an occupational therapist, a former clinical faculty member of UNC's TEACCH Autism Program, and the founder of <a href="https://learnplaythrive.com">Learn Play Thrive</a> and Learn PLay Thrive Parents. She's spent the last five years learning from the experiences of Autistic adults and training over 10,000 professionals in strengths-based approaches.</p>
