    <summary>Can I share this training with my friends and family?</summary>
    <p>
      We all thrive in community. While each registration is only for one person or one family, you can still host a "watch party" as long as everyone attending also registers for the summit themselves.

    <summary>I'm a provider. Can I do a group viewing of this training for parents at my clinic/school/office?</summary>
    <p>
      Thanks for your eagerness to share! You can share the talks with families as long as they each register for the summit on our website. Please have them each register individually before sharing. If you'd like to do this with a sign-up sheet, email us at <a mailto="parents@learnplaythrive.com">parents@learnplaythrive.com</a> and we'll get you set up.
