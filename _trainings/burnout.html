        <h3>
          <b>Meltdowns</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A meltdown is a full body response to feeling overwhelmed. In a meltdown, our kids' nervous systems are in survival mode. They are going to fight for their lives or flee for safety. One way or another, they are physically releasing the energy of their intense emotions. When this happens, what is in our control, and how can we respond to signal safety to their nervous system? How can we turn down the temperature and bring the child back to safety?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="part">
        <h3>
          <b>Shutdowns</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A shutdown is a type of distress that is often missed. A shutdown is an overwhelmed child, in survival brain, who is frozen. Instead of releasing their energy, it all goes inward. They may seem absent or withdrawn. Or they may become overly compliant. But this is an emotional crisis and a child who desperately needs to feel safe and resolve their sense of overwhelm. How do we help them find themselves again, self-advocate, and find safety without abandoning their inner feelings?

      <div class="part">
        <h3>
          <b>Burnout</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Burnout is a long-term state of physical, emotional, and cognitive exhaustion. It's caused by ongoing stress and unmet needs. When our kids are in burnout, their energy is depleted, they are losing their skills, and they become more sensitive. How do we nurture a child in burnout back to their full, bright, safe selves? How do we prevent Autistic burnout?
