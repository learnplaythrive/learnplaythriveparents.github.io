## HOW IT WORKS

Starting on November 1st, we’ll release one pre-recorded 20-minute interview a day for two weeks. And if you get behind, you’ll have access on-demand for the full month of November.

Your presenters are some of the strongest voices in neurodiversity-affirming practice in the fields of occupational therapy, speech therapy, medicine, and more.

## THIS FREE SUMMIT IS FOR YOU IF

You are a parent or caregiver for an Autistic child and care deeply about their felt sense of safety, belonging, and inclusion.

You want strategies to use in your parenting that are affirming of who your child is, not aimed at changing them.

You believe (or can imagine) that learning from Autistic adults is one important way to more deeply understand your Autistic child.

You want to belong to a community of parents and caregivers who don’t see parenting an Autistic child as a burden, nor do they take it on as their identity. You want to connect with other parents who are simply striving to learn how to be on their child’s team in a world that isn’t set up for their Autistic child’s success.

You can commit to carving out one or more 20-minute chunks of time at some point in the month of November to learn new ways to support your Autistic child.

## FAQ

{% include_relative summit-2024/_faqs.html %}

It’s hard to be a parent in this world. And even harder when nothing is set up for the way your child thinks, learns, plays, communicates, and experiences the world. Let us help you create more acceptance, ease, well-being, and inclusion for your Autistic child in their daily life.
