    <summary>Will this course help me with my PDAer?</summary>
    <p>
      Maybe. This course is not designed specifically for Autistic kids with a PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance) profile. If your child responds well to structure and clear instructions, this course is likely to be supportive for you. We plan to release a course on PDA soon, so stay tuned!
