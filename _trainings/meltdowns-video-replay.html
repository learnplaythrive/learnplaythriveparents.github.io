  Recorded Replay: 20 Minute Webinar + 20 Minute Q&A

  When your Autistic kid is in meltdown, what is in your control, and how can you respond to signal safety to their nervous system? In this free, on-demand webinar, you'll learn a mindset shift and safety planning strategies to help you manage aggressive meltdowns in a way that helps bring your kid back to safety, without overextending your own nervous system. You'll also get a free PDF of Amanda Diekman's scripts for how to respond to others when your child is in distress.
